## Preamble

Welcome ðŸ‘‹! This is Group 6's Final Project, and here is our detailed work

Consider the wine quality dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Respository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)[^1]. We will focus only on the data concerning white wines (and not red wines). Dichotomize the `quality` variable as `good`, which takes the value 1 if quality â‰¥ 7 axnd the value 0, otherwise. We will take `good` as response and all the 11 physiochemical characteristics of the wines in the data as predictors.

### Problem Statements

Use 10-fold cross-validation for estimating the test error rates below and compute the estimates using `caret` package with seed set to 1234 before each computation.

(a) Fit a KNN with K chosen optimally using test error rate. Report error rate, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for the optimal KNN based on the training data. Also, report its estimated test error rate.
(b) Repeat (a) using logistic regression.
(c) Repeat (a) using LDA.
(d) Repeat (a) using QDA.
(e) Compare the results in (a)-(d). Which classifier would you recommend? Justify your answer.
